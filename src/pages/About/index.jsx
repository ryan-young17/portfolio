                    <p className='bio'>My name is Ryan. I am a creative at heart who is driven by the beauty of the written word and all things design. I find joy in creating a natural rhythm of words or a provocative metaphor&#8212;and inspiration in the limitless world of digital design.<br/><br/>After discovering these passions and recognizing my meticulous nature and knack for problem solving, I turned to code to learn something new&#8212;challenge myself&#8212;and find that thing that calls to all my passions. Front-end web development was the ticket, and since taking the bootcamp course, I canâ€™t get enough of it. Experimenting with passion projects and learning new languages is how I spend most of my free time these days. So far, I have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, jQuery, Bootstrap, React, Node.JS, MongoDB, Express.JS, and Git/GitHub; and I am currently learning Swift. Though I am drawn to front-end web development, I also thoroughly enjoy exercising my creative spirit writing or designing print and digital graphics. With a professional background in marketing, I hold an advanced perspective on effective design and intentional language. I am open to any opportunity to create, collaborate, or jump on board with a company that fosters creativity and growth.</p>
